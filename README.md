## About

Android application that allows organization and planning of various activities. Activities can be related to work, leisure, travel, etc.
At a minimum, each activity should contain a name, time, description and location. Leisure activities can also contain several images, which can be uploaded from
gallery, make using the device's camera, or download from a remote location.
A calendar display of activities is enabled, for easier monitoring. In addition, it is possible to display activities in the form of a list, with chronologically ordered items, whereby the list can be searched by activity name. When starting the application, a notification/reminder for activities that will happen in the near future is displayed. The period is defined through settings.
Within a special page with settings, it is possible to choose the language and set notifications (on/off, notification time: an hour earlier, a day earlier, or seven days earlier).

- Create new activity with specified name, description, date, location.
